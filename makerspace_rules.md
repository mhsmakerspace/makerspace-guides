# Makerspace Rules

## General Safety
* Never enter the space without appropriate supervision.
* Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment, or [PPE](##AppropriatePPE).
* Think. Your brain is your most effective safety equipment. If you think what you're about to do seems like a bad idea, it probably is.
* Use equipment appropriately and in the manner in which it is intended to be used.
* If something is damaged, do not use it. Report it to a teacher immediately.
