# Laser Cutter Usage Guide
## General Info
* The laser cutter is an Epilog Helix 60W.
* It operates using a printer driver. Any vector line .001” (.072 points) in thickness will be vector cut (if vector cutting or combined is chosen in the print options), and anything else will be raster engraved, in greyscale. Darker colors in your print will be engraved darker and deeper.
* More info on the product line is [here](https://www.epiloglaser.com/products/legend-laser-series.htm)
* Don’t use any materials containing vinyl. They release chlorine gas. For obvious reasons, we don’t want to do that.
* If you have questions about a material, let me know. There’s also a good list of some of the more common materials in the manual where you find the settings for the laser.

## Computer Setup
* Install the [driver](https://www.epiloglaser.com/tech-support/mini-helix-drivers.htm)
* When you go to print, remember to switch to the correct printer

## General Use (not including special techniques)
* Create your document. 
* Put your material in the bed of the laser cutter (this can happen at any time before you actually press “Go” on the laser cutter). The edges should go right up against the ruler (they’ll be sitting on the metal edge of the cutting bed)
* Turn on the laser cutter
* Connect to the laser cutter using the USB cable
* Send your file to the laser cutter
* Choose print
* Select the laser cutter as your printer
* Adjust your settings through “properties”
* Send the job to the laser cutter by saying okay to the print dialog
* Make sure the correct file name shows on the laser cutter screen. If not, the job didn’t send. Check your connection and make sure you actually pressed okay on the computer
* Remember to turn on the fume extractor (huge black box next to the laser cutter) and the air compressor (underneath the laser cutter). This prevents fires and unpleasant fumes
* Press “Go” on the laser cutter
* Keep an eye on the print. If it starts to flare up, press “Stop” on the laser cutter and it should settle down.
* When it’s done, you can take out your part. If there are no more parts to cut, turn everything off

## Settings
* Recommended settings come from the manual. Find the page for the 60W Helix. The manual is pretty much always open to that page
* Always turn on autofocus
* Set your page size to the size of your document
* Choose “raster” (engraving only), “vector” (cutting only), or “combined” (both cutting and engraving)
* Set power, speed, and (if doing vector cutting) frequency using the recommended settings
